nginx/nginx,436,I have been actually working quite heavily with nginx and pkcs11-provider in recent months and have got some fixes for the PIN issues . In my case it's even more complicated because I have pkcs11-proxy in between. But mostly it's more a problem that the key refresh uri is not always passed . What is specified in pkcs11-module-token-pin is used as the default pin if no pin is provided with a key. This is also important when client cert is used because it will use it for importing the public key . So basically you need to always set pkcs11-module-token-pin to the first slot PIN and then specify PIN's for all key in the PKCS11 URI.,Constructive Positive,Clarity & Context

keras-team/keras,21615,"Thanks for the response. After some consideration, I think adding support for variadic positional arguments is not worth the effort, as it breaks up the simple notion of the config being a dictionary that can be passed via . Also, being positional only, the same argument name may be used inside as well, leading to possible collisions if we would expand to store all arguments in the same flat dictionary.",Constructive Positive,Actionable Feedback

No, positional-only arguments are also not supported with the current implementation, as calling will pass the items of config as keyword arguments, which is not allowed for positional-only arguments.

keras-team/keras,21548,"Actually, the current solution in this PR already works for model fit/evaluate/predict across Jax/TF/Torch backends on single data batches as well as batches provided by a generator - even when the latter generates ""mixed"" optional input values **except in TF backend where an error is raised in this very specific case**. The core reason is that TF backend uses TF Dataset under the hood, which doesn't support None values, so we need to convert optional input values from None/tensor to tf.experimental.Optional in the data adapter, and back to None/tensor as expected by Keras model for optional inputs. But doing this last conversion in a way that is traceable by TF AutoGraph is not trivial, since TF control flow operators like tf.cond also don't support returning ...",Constructive Positive,Risk Awareness

Rudrabha/Wav2Lip,207,"@prajwalkr i did not consider the use case of having a synced audio and video to begin with. i guess in this case when you have voice but no face showing, you would actually want to keep these frames in without applying wav2lip - ""pass"" strategy. but for the more general case of different video and audio, i think what i am doing is consistent with the ""audio first"" approach as originally implemented, that is, trim video if longer than audio, or loop video if shorter than audio. so my idea here was just to extract the usable frames. although one could argue that if you have partially faded frames - this is not what you want anyway the pass frames strategy could also make sense in the general use case . the pass strategy could also be useful for intermediate frames without face which i do not currently take care of - I ""break"" to end the video there and allow it to loop, but you could alternatively either just ""cut"" the frames until the next face or ""pass"" and leave in the unprocessed frames. please note that my change addresses the case where the code would otherwise return an error. but on top of that you could consider offering several options: ""cut"" or ""pass"" for the beginning. ""cut"" or ""pass"" or ""break"" for intermediate faceless frames. ""cut"" or ""pass"" for the ending . my implementation is for 1=cut and 2=break. sorry for overly long answer.",Constructive Positive,Actionable Feedback

It would be good to know why it fails to install in you CI/CD environment, but this change now breaks everyone who has in their file without an extra index URL our anyone who is simply using . There were other ""magic"" ways to accomplish forcing certain dependencies to install from another server but the version specifier with URL included is not allowed on pypi.org. This is really an issue with the python package index and not allowing external hosting to support larger packages or a way to reference another server without adding new indexes for all packages. They really need something like docker has with their pull syntax. This is why PyTorch has to use their complex install procedure to work around the package size limits of 1gb.

Ultimately from launch there needs to be one module that handles user interaction, with modules imported and unloaded as necessary when it's determined what the user wants to do. Really, nothing should happen as the user goes through the menu items except prep for the final action . Right now as the user navigates through the menus they are executing what they are wanting to do as it goes along. If there's a choke along the way there isn't any handling for what has already been imported, what module is currently running, etc. It should be like giving your order at a restaurant: when everything is lined up as it needs to be - then it gets sent to the kitchen .",Constructive Positive,Clarity & Context

trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit,11,"Thanks for including the code. Unfortunately, you seem to have reverted most of my changes and the current version does not do what I intended - it's still not possible to place the harvester logfile to a directory that is not part of the Apache path for security reasons.

kitware/CMake,182,"Thanks for adding this support, I'm actually addressing a similar issue with my changes to enable Windows 10 support but in a different way. Because there always seems to have new file types that people want to add which are fairly easy to support generically, I've added a new source property VS_TOOL_OVERRIDE. By default each extension that the VisualStudio generator knows about will appear with their appropriate tool, or none, if the generator doesn't know about the filetype. If you set VS_TOOL_OVERRIDE then you can specify a different tool to apply to that source file. For example, I'm applying the PRIResource tool to a .resw file achieving similar results to what you are doing but with the added advantage that this can add a new file type without needing to teach CMake about it.",Constructive Positive,Clarity & Context
